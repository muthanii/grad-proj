## **TL;DR**

This project is based on the power of the Python library LangChain. It is an open source framework used to create AI apps and agents with a varitey of LLM integrations and tools. The LLM chosen for being the most easy to use in our specific case was Cohere. Streamlit was used to make and host the user interface of this application. They had an amazing and easy to use APIs for LLM chatbot cases.
